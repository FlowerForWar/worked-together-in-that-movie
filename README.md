# Worked together in that movie
[Github](https://github.com/FlowerForWar/worked-together-in-that-movie), [Greasy Fork Discussion](https://greasyfork.org/en/discussions/development/137330-user-script-idea-worked-together-in-that-movie), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/userscripts/comments/v7cjsi/user_script_idea_worked_together_in_that_movie/)

An idea for a user script that works on IMDb.   
Click+Ctrl an actor name will bring a dialog that would offer searching for other actors, and finally tell you what movies the two actors worked together in, if any.

## Building the project
* If you know how to code, I can use collaborators
* if you want to build the project yourself, please do and share
* If you have ideas for the project, feel free to share them

I'm likley to build it someday, but will take some time, as I have other user scripts to maintain.
